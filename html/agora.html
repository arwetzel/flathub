                >AGORA High-resolution Galaxy Simulations Comparison Project </a
                > investigates galaxy formation with high-resolution simulations and compares the results across code platforms and with observations. The goal is to verify that the astrophysical assumptions are responsible for any success in galaxy simulations, not artifacts of particular numerical implementations. By guaranteeing reproducibility, we aim to improve numerical experiments as one of the most powerful tools in formulating theories of galaxy formation. This is a one-of-a-kind, inter-institutional effort by more than 160 participants from over 60 institutions worldwide. We welcome anybody who is interested in participating in the AGORA project, especially with new codes.
            </p>
            <p>The AGORA infrastructure include common cosmological initial conditions (4 halo masses and 2 assembly histories generated using MUSIC), common isolated initial conditions (generated with MakeDisk), common astrophysics models (cooling and UV background implemented via the GRACKLE package), and a common analysis platform (yt toolkit), all publicly available to the community. Using the components assembled, the ongoing collaborative efforts aim to increase the realism of numerical experiments collectively, resulting in multiple publications in the next few years. </p>
