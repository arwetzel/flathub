  <p>The simulations presented here are Models D1, D2, M1 and M2 from Hunt et al. (2021). They are freely available, but please cite Hunt et al. (2021) if you use them! Currently available are the snapshots presented in the paper, but we intend to make the full time evolution available (at 9.77 Myr intervals) available shortly.</p>
  <p>For the dark matter particles we provide x, y, z (kpc), v_x, v_y, v_z (km/s), mass (Solar mass), and particle ID. For the stellar particles, we provide as above, but also include actions, angles and frequencies derived with Agama (<a class="underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.482.1525V/abstract">Vasiliev 2019</a>): J_R, J_phi, J_z (kpc km/s), theta_R, theta_phi, theta_z (radians) and Omega_R, Omega_phi, Omega_z (km/s /kpc).</p>
  <p>Model D1 is an isolated Milky Way like disc galaxy based on Model MWb from <a class="underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005ApJ...631..838W/abstract">Widrow & Dubinski (2005)</a>. It remains stable against bar and spiral formation for several Gyr. We present snapshot 200 on Flathub for comparison with the merger model M1 as an example of the un-perturbed galaxy.</p>
  <p>Model D2 is an isolated disc galaxy based on Model MWa from <a class="underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005ApJ...631..838W/abstract">Widrow & Dubinski (2005)</a>. It forms a bar and transient spiral structure. We present snapshot 549 on Flathub for comparison with the merger model M2 as an example of the un-perturbed galaxy.</p>
  <p>Model M1 is the merger of the L2 dwarf galaxy from <a class="underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.481..286L/abstract">Laporte et al. (2018)</a> into Model D1. This is an excellent test case for the structure and kinematics induced by the merger, as the disc otherwise remains stable. We present step 702 on Flathub as the `present day’ snapshot, where the dwarf is closest to the location of Sgr in the Milky Way.</p>
  <p>Model M2 is the merger of the L2 dwarf galaxy from <a class="underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.481..286L/abstract">Laporte et al. (2018)</a> into Model D2. This is a violent merger which creates a thick disc and inner halo from the dwarf remnant. We present snapshot 557 on Flathub as the ‘final’ state of the system.</p>
  <p>Note that these models are not intended to be accurate reproductions of the Milky Way - Sgr system, merely test cases for the dynamical processes involved in Disc-dwarf mergers. See Bennet, Bovy & Hunt (2021) for our attempts to better match observations of the Milky Way - Sagittarius dwarf galaxy merger.</p>
